Warning: setting rotation step to 45 degrees according to Object Goal Navigation dataset in iTHOR.
Warning: setting visibility distance to 1 meter according to Object Goal Navigation standard setting.
Warning: setting max manipulation distance to 163 (>150) centimeters for solving the Object Goal Navigation task in iTHOR. In this way the agent is more robust to error in object position approximations.
Warning: setting distance threshold of predicate 'close_to(object)' to 150 centimeters for solving the Object Goal Navigation task in iTHOR. In this way the agent is more robust to error in object position approximations.
